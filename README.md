# Word Memory (Human Benchmark minigame)

Since the original Human Benchmark is not online at the moment, I wanted to go ahead and recreate the only minigame I was really good at. Have fun!

## How it works

You will be shown one word at a time, and you have to decide if you have *SEEN* that word previously, or if it's a *NEW* word in the rotation. The longest uninterrupted streak works. That's it, not complex at all. The real fun comes from obliterating your friend's and family's highscores, like all games.
